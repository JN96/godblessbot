## godblessbot

A Twitter bot that takes a somewhat satirical and humorous take on the phrase 'God bless' by blessing
anything and everything using.

### Highlights
 - Uses the [node-twitter-api-v2]([https://github.com/PLhery/node-twitter-api-v2) client for Tweet automation. 
 - Uses the [Wordnik]([https://www.wordnik.com/) dictionary API for retrieving random words.

### Prerequisites
Running the script:
 - Node
 - Twitter developer account
 - Twitter API access credentials
 - Wordnik API Key

### Usage
Clone it, set up your own .env variables or don't... Just hardcode any **_process.env.VARIABLES_** 
with your own information. 

While in the project's root, run the following:
 1. ```npm install```
 2. ```node index.js``` 

That's it. 
God bless and take care.
