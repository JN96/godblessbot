## godblessbot

A Twitter bot that takes a somewhat satirical and humorous take no the phrase 'God bless' by blessing
anything and everything using [Twit]([https://github.com/ttezel/twit). Requires Node. 

Clone it, set up your own .env variables or don't... Just hardcode any **_process.env.VARIABLES_** 
with your own account specific information. 

Then in project root run:
 1. ```npm install```
 2. ```node index.js``` 

That's it. 
God bless and take care.
